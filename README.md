#Linear Quadtrees with Level Differences in Python 3 (LQTLD3)

 
This is the Python 3 version of [LQTLD](https://github.com/dwrodri/LQTLD), and is a much cleaner implementation. I also 
have begun to attempt to implement [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) in order to put some speedup into the matrix 
operations.
